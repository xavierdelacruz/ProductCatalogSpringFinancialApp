# Product Catalog Frontend
A simple React single-page application (SPA) that interacts with the Product Catalog backend API. It supports product browsing, searching, and pagination.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16+ recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

---

##  Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd product-catalog-frontend
```
Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

Running the App

```
npm start
``` 

This will launch the app at ```http://localhost:3000```

It connects to the backend API at:
```https://localhost:7105/api/ProductCatalog```

Make sure your backend is running on https://localhost:7105 before testing the frontend.

## Features
- Search products by name, brand, category, etc.
- Paginate results with next/previous controls
- Live data fetched via axios from a .NET API

## Notes:
If you see CORS errors, update your backend (.NET) to allow http://localhost:3000

To change the backend API URL, edit in App.js:
```
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://localhost:7105/api/ProductCatalog';
```

## Scripts
```
npm run build      # Production build
npm run test       # Run tests (none yet) - TODO
```
